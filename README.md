# Project Paléolife - Starter Kit - Symfony

## Presentation

This project is a showcase site for the enterprise paléolife.
This site show the activity of the coach Sébastien Mirland. He have another functionnality, a profil page for each user which are registered. The admin of this site can control his service, his clients and the program and diet of his clients.
The client, on the other hand, can upload his picture and add his measurement.

It's symfony website-skeleton project with some additional library (webpack, fixtures) and tools to validate code standards.

* GrumPHP, as pre-commit hook, will run 2 tools when `git commit` is run :

    * PHP_CodeSniffer to check PSR12
    * PHPStan focuses on finding errors in your code (without actually running it)
    * PHPmd will check if you follow PHP best practices

  If tests fail, the commit is canceled and a warning message is displayed to developper.

* Github Action as Continuous Integration will be run when a branch with active pull request is updated on github. It will run :

    * Tasks to check if vendor, .idea, env.local are not versionned,
    * PHP_CodeSniffer, PHPStan and PHPmd with same configuration as GrumPHP.


### Prerequisites

1. Check composer is installed
2. Check yarn & node are installed

### Install

1. Clone this project
2. Duplicate the file .env in .env.local
3. Comment the line 31 and decomment the line 30, then change the db_user, db_password and db_name by your own
4. If you want to test the send email, add your own mailer dsn in line 42
5. Run `composer install`
6. Run `yarn install`
7. Run `yarn encore dev` to build assets

### Working

1. Run `symfony server:start` to launch your local php web server
2. Run `yarn run dev --watch` to launch your local server for assets (or `yarn dev-server` do the same with Hot Module Reload activated)

### Testing

1. Run `php ./vendor/bin/phpcs` to launch PHP code sniffer
2. Run `php ./vendor/bin/phpstan analyse src --level max` to launch PHPStan
3. Run `php ./vendor/bin/phpmd src text phpmd.xml` to launch PHP Mess Detector
4. Run `./node_modules/.bin/eslint assets/js` to launch ESLint JS linter

### Windows Users

If you develop on Windows, you should edit your git configuration to change your end of line rules with this command:

`git config --global core.autocrlf true`

The `.editorconfig` file in root directory do this for you. You probably need `EditorConfig` extension if your IDE is VSCode.

### Run locally with Docker

1. Fill DATABASE_URL variable in .env.local file with
`DATABASE_URL="mysql://root:password@database:3306/<choose_a_db_name>"`
2. Install Docker Desktop an run the command:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
3. Wait a moment and visit http://localhost:8000
